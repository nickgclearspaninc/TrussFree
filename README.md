This repo contains code for reading and writing to various kinds of component files.

The prefabricated component industry has long needed a common file type to help interface the various systems found throughout the industry. Each equipment manufacturer in the industry has had to rewrite this same code to allow their products to work with data from multiple software providers. Any component manufacturer wanting to build their own tools has had to do the same in order to interface with existing systems. With this library, all of that duplicated effort will be consolidated into a single place. While a single ubiquitous file type has yet to emerge and garner widespread support, this code will bridge the gap between different software systems in the industry.

This project is in the early stages of development. In the near future, this library will provide the ability to read and write much of the data contained in 

* .tre
* .kxr
* .trs

and other truss component files. If you have suggestions, questions, or thoughts of any kind. Jump in [the chatroom](https://tlk.io/truss-free) and say hi. Or you create an issue in [our issue tracker](https://bitbucket.org/buildfreely/truss-free/issues?status=new&status=open)

We will be updating this readme with a detailed tutorial of how to get started soon
